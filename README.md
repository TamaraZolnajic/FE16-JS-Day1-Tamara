Exercise 1
Create a internal Javascript program <script> that:

Prints within the console "Hello from the Console" and where the browser displays "Hello from the Browser".  



Exercise 2


Create an external Javascript program and link it to an HTML document.  It has to print the following message in the console "Hi my name is Martin". Once the HTML file is opened, it should display the message from the Javascript.



Exercise 3


Extend the previous example (Basic exercise 2) by adding the following text to it "and I am 25 years old". This text should come from the script within the body tag in the HTML document. The age value should come from a variable.




Exercise 4
Create an array called players. Add the following names as values to it: Martin, Thomas, Peter, Mathias and Niki. 

Output only the third player in the console.  The text should be: "The most valuable player of the match is <third_player_name>".
  
  Intermediate
Exercise 1


Write a JavaScript program that will sort the following values alphabetically: Tesla, Audi, Renault, Volvo, Mazda, Fiat and Ferrari.

(Use an array to contain these values)




Exercise 2
Create a program where:



1. The first array contains the following values:

 apple, banana, kiwi



Using different methods, the output should be as follows:

apple, banana, kiwi, orange

apple, banana, kiwi

(Each statement should be outputted on a separate line.)



2. The second array contains the following values:

monkey, horse, dog



Using different methods, the output should be as follows:

dog, horse, monkey

cat, dog, horse, monkey



Exercise 3


Create a variable containing the following string:

"mango/cherries/kiwi/grapes/pear/peach/orange/lemon"



Create a program that will output each fruit on a separate line in the web browser:

mango 

cherries 

kiwi 

grapes

pear 

peach 

orange 

lemon
  
  Advanced
Exercise 1

Sum the following variables and store the result in one new variable:

var a = 7;

var b = 14;

var c = "21";

var d = '36';

var e = 42;

Multiply the following variables and store the result in one new variable:

var f = '1';

var g = 15;

var h = 8;

var i = "1";

Divide the two results that you got from the arithmetic operations and print the result in the web browser.


Exercise 2
From the following multidimensional Array:

[ [1, 2, 1, 24], [8, 11, 9, 4], [7, 0, 7, 27], [7, 4, 28, 14], [3, 10, 25, 7], [21, 4, 6, 17], [3, 5, 26, 3] ]

Select and output the numbers 11, 25, 17, 27 and 0 in the console.

Challenge

String Manipulation


Structure the following sentence:

"Properties,$a$set$of$immutable$values,$are$passed$to$a$component's$renderer$as$properties$in$its $HTML$tag.$A$component$cannot$directly$modify$any$properties$passed$to$it,$but$can$be$passed$ callback$functions$that$do$modify$values.$This$mechanism's$promise$is$expressed$as$properties $flow$down;$actions$flow$up".



The result should be:

"Properties, a set of immutable values, are passed to a component's renderer as properties in its  HTML tag. A component cannot directly modify any properties passed to it, but can be passed callback functions that do modify values. This mechanism's promise is expressed as properties flow down; actions flow up"

(Commas are also accepted as a division between the words.)
